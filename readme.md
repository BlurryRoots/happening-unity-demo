# Happening Unity Demo

A demo on how to work with [happening](https://github.com/BlurryRoots/happening).

## Overview

You will find the demo scene called *main* under ```Assets/CoreGame/Scenes```. In this scene, there is a simple custom player controller in front of a contraption. When entering the archway, a trap will be triggered dropping a red block onto the player and releasing a catapult mounted on the bottom of the archway.

Have a look into the scripts found in ```Assets/CoreGame/Scripts```, to see how to setup and use happening to react to events or use it as communication tool between modules.

## Controls

Use *WASD*, the *arrow keys* or the *left thumb stick* of an *xbox 360 controller*.
